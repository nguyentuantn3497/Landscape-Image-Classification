# Landscape Image Classification
This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world. This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test.

Now, We need to prepare our data to feed into the model. There is a builtin method in Keras that can extract your images from folder.
